# PyGame-Graph-Theory-SketchPad
Graph Theory Sketch Pad that allows one to: Model graphs and compute properties of said graphs, such as Hamiltonian Cycles and Bipartite.


How to Use:

run the program. the click v on your keyboard. this will put you in "vertex creation mode" click anywhere on your screen to add a vertex there.
click d, this will put you in "vertex and edge deletion mode" this will delete vertices and edges when you click on them.
click e, this will put you in "edge creation mode" this will create and edge when you click on two vertices.
click g, this will out put the degree of each vertex on screen. 

the buttons on the side all send messages to the console about the truth of their respective questions. e.g. if you click "connected?" and the 
graph is connected, the console will log "our graph is connected".
